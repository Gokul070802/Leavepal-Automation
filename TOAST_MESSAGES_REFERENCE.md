# Toast Messages Reference — Leave Management System
> **For automation / QA validation use**
> All toasts are rendered via `notify(message, type)` or `window.showTopRightNotification(message, type)` — both call the same underlying function from `ui-notifications.js`.

> - AL11 appears only when **every** submission attempt returns a non-OK HTTP status.

## 11. Automation Tips

1. **Toast selector**: Toasts appear in a container rendered by `ui-notifications.js`. Target `.leavepal-toast` elements (or whatever class your version uses) — check the toast type via the CSS class suffix (`.toast-success`, `.toast-error`, `.toast-warning`).

2. **Timing**: Toasts auto-dismiss after ~3–5 seconds. Poll for presence within the first 2 seconds after the triggering action. Default timeout is configurable via `timeoutMs` option (example: AE8 uses `{ timeoutMs: 2200 }`).

3. **Partial matches for dynamic toasts**: For AL12, assert `contains("Loss of Pay")` and `contains("Both sent to your manager for approval")`.

4. **Server-message fallback pattern**: Many error toasts are `message || 'Default fallback text'`. The server's response body is used when available. Always assert on the *exact* server message or use a `startsWith`/`contains` approach for these.

5. **Session expired (401)**: Toast `Session expired. Please login again.` (warning) appears before redirect to login page.
